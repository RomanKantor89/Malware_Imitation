# Malware_Imitation
Python project using networking and multi processing concepts

## Overview
Malware imitation software with daemonized server and client. The idea is to use human vulnerability to access someones host by offering a software that pretends to generate the winning lottery numbers. While the user is busy playing with the lottery numbers, the client is making another connection through SSH to our server to retrieve the malicious logic and start spying on the user.

## Running instructions:  

make sure both `server.py` and `client.py` has 744 permission  

do in order:  
1. `./server.py start`  
1. `./client.py` <-- then enter values  
1. after this line, there should be a `lotteryNumber.txt` file generated  
1. `ps aux | grep py` <-- should see 2 server.py processes and 1 client.py process  
1. `crontab -l` <-- should see 1 line of cronjob started with `@reboot`  
1. For CURRENT version, a file called `maliciousfile` will be generated where `client.py` is, and there will be contented added to that file every minute
